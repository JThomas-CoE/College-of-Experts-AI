capability_scope: |
  Statistical analysis, probability, hypothesis testing.
  
  STRONG CAPABILITIES:
  - Descriptive statistics: mean, median, variance, percentiles
  - Probability: distributions, conditional probability, Bayes
  - Distributions: normal, binomial, Poisson, exponential, t, chi-square
  - Hypothesis testing: z-test, t-test, chi-square, ANOVA
  - Confidence intervals: construction, interpretation
  - Regression: linear, multiple, interpretation, diagnostics
  - Correlation: Pearson, Spearman, partial correlation
  - Sampling: methods, sample size, power analysis
