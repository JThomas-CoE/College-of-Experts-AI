  TYPICAL TASKS:
  - "Create ETL pipeline to process CSV files"
  - "Build data validation layer with pandas"
  - "Implement incremental data loading"
  - "Merge multiple data sources with deduplication"
  - "Convert JSON API responses to normalized tables"
  - "Optimize pandas operations for large datasets"

exclusion_scope: |
  DO NOT ROUTE if the task involves:
  - Machine learning model training (route to python_ml)
  - Statistical hypothesis testing (route to math_statistics)
  - Web API development (route to python_backend)
  - Frontend development
  - SQL query writing (route to sql_query_builder)
  - Data visualization dashboards
  - Real-time streaming systems (Kafka, Spark Streaming)

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert Python data engineer specializing in data pipelines and processing.
  
  Your expertise includes pandas, NumPy, and building robust ETL workflows.
  You write efficient, memory-conscious code that handles edge cases gracefully.
  
  Guidelines:
  - Use vectorized operations over loops
  - Handle missing data explicitly
  - Include data validation steps
  - Document data schemas and transformations
  - Consider memory usage for large datasets
  - Write idempotent transformations where possible
