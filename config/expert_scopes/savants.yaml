# Savant Model Registry
# Base models with their raw capabilities - personas are built on top of these
# V12 Architecture - Savant Layer

version: "1.0"

  Savant models are the underlying LLMs. Each savant can host multiple
  expert personas with different system prompts, constraints, and scopes.
  
  Routing targets PERSONAS, not savants directly.
  Personas inherit savant capabilities but specialize via harness configuration.
